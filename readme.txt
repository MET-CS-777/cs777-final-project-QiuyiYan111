1. Data set description: Provide a detailed description of the public data set you have selected, including its source, format, and any relevant details about the data

I use Movielens 200k dataset, it include the rating.csv and movie.csv  this two form shows the information of users, rate, movie name and it's genres.

2. Research question: Clearly define your research question and explain why studying is important. What do you want to learn from the data?

My question is can we build a model to predict a movie is high rate or lower rate by using it name OR genres?

3. Machine Learning model: Specify the type of machine learning model you plan to use, such as classification or clustering, and explain why you have chosen this model.

I make this in logic regression and SVM model; and i let the rate which higher equal than 4 as a high rate, otherwise it is  a low rate.

4.Expected outcomes: What do you expect to achieve after implementing your learning model? What do you hope to learn or discover from your data analysis?

I expect it could do it correct and give me a good result in the test part. 

5. Evaluation plan: Explain how you plan to evaluate your project and assess the correctness of your model. What metrics or methods will you use to evaluate the effectiveness of your learning model? How well do you expect the model to work, and how will you measure its performance?

I use the confusion matrix and F1 score to evaluate it.
